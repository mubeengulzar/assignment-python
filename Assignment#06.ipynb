    "1)\tIt provides a clear modular structure for programs.\n",

    "3)\tIt makes software easier to maintain.\n",
    "4)\tReuse also enables faster development.\n",
    "5)\tIt provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is specifically use for developing graphical user interface.\n",
    "6)\tBetter Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "7)\tDesign Benefits:  can make the work easier for the programmer for fixing the elements easily. And make it towards improvement. And eliminate the risks.\n",
    "8)\t It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "9)\tIt implements real life scenario.\n",
    "10)\tIn OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures."
